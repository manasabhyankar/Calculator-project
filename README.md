#Calculator Project

This is a project to create a calculator in-browser using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

Will support basic arithmetic operations and chained expressions (e.g 1+2+3-4*6) as well as floating point output and keyboard input.

The goal of this project was to combine aspects of visual design (HTML, CSS) and provide it functionality with Javascript.
