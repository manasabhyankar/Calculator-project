This is a project to create a calculator in-browser using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Not currently the prettiest looking calculator, but it's functional.

Currently supports:

    - Basic arithmetic functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
    - Clearing of the result display.
    - Deletion of elements in the result display.
    - Evaluation of expression in the result display.

Will support in the future:

    - Typing expressions using keyboard.
    - Floating point decimal results.
    - Moving the expression prior to clicking the 'equals' button to the top left of the display for user QoL.
    - Looking good.


The goal of this project was to combine aspects of visual design (HTML, CSS) and provide it functionality with Javascript. I learned quickly how to properly align HTML elements using both DOM styling via Javascript and manual placement via HTML strictly. The CSS aspect of designing elements, color choices, elements alignments and orientations, and graphical pleasantly is still to come for me. However, I think the simplicity of such an application makes for easy design choices and my current goal is to reflect the simplicity of the calculator into its visual design.
